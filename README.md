Edit
This is a specific pnpm lockfile configuration mismatch error that's common in Vercel deployments. Let me search for the exact solution to this issue.
Based on my research, this is a common issue with pnpm version mismatches and configuration discrepancies in Vercel deployments. Here are the specific solutions to fix your ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH error:
Immediate Solutions (Try These in Order):
Solution 1: Update Your Lockfile Locally

In your local project directory, run:
bashpnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile

Commit the updated pnpm-lock.yaml:
bashgit add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Update pnpm lockfile"
git push


Solution 2: Configure Vercel Build Settings

Go to your Vercel project dashboard
Navigate to Settings → Build & Development Settings
Override the Install Command with:
bashpnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile


Solution 3: Add Package Manager Version to package.json
This issue often occurs with pnpm 10.4 Error Codes, so specify your pnpm version:

Add this to your package.json:
json{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.12.1"
}
(Use pnpm 9.x instead of 10.x as pnpm 9 passes smoothly Error Codes)
Run locally:
bashcorepack up
pnpm install


Solution 4: Create/Update vercel.json
Create a vercel.json file in your project root:
json{
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile"
}
Solution 5: Environment Variable Fix
Add the environment variable in Vercel Next.js 15 + React 19 - shadcn/ui:

In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
Add:

Name: ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK
Value: 1



Why This Happens:

pnpm version mismatch between Vercel and your lockfile Troubleshooting Build Errors
Your pnpm-lock.yaml is outdated and not in sync with package.json Vercel Deploy error (application created by v0) · vercel/next.js · Discussion #74823
Configuration changes in your package.json (like "overrides") don't match what's in the lockfile

Recommended Approach:

Start with Solution 1 (update lockfile locally)


# ESLint must be installed in order to run during builds: pnpm install --save-dev eslint Failed to compile.
Removed any existing `.eslintrc.json` file
Created a new, simpler ESLint configuration
Downgraded ESLint and related packages to more stable versions:

- ESLint from 8.57.0 to 8.56.0
- TypeScript ESLint plugin from 8.33.1 to 6.19.0
- ESLint config Next from 15.2.4 to 14.1.0
